# Introduction
Breathalyzer testing has become a crucial component of the DGCA's safety protocols, 
aiming to prevent the operational people directly or indirectly involved in the aircraft 
movement (Pilots, Crews, Controllers, Engineers, and ground staff) from under the 
influence of alcohol. 

By acting as a strong deterrent against alcohol consumption 
before or during duty, these tests contribute to a safer and more responsible aviation 
workforce.

# Objective
- Develop a software -based randomizer for the Breath Analyzer(BA) test
- Maintaining records to comply with the DGCA requirements

# Features
- Interactive web application 
- Department-wise login facility 
- Transparent selection due to randomizer algorithm 
- Prevent multiple runs of the randomizer program 
- Secure and Reliable Data management
